This is a Complete Java project on Airline reservation System using Spring Boot and Hibernate with the database handling.

Airline reservation systems are systems that allow an airline to sell their inventory. It contains information on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations and of tickets issued. ARSs are part of passenger service systems, which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.
